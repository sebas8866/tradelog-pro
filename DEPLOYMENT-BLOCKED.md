## 📊 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Build | ✅ Complete |
| Files | ✅ Ready |
| Vercel Account | ⏳ Pending signup |
| Deployment | ⏳ Blocked |
| Live Website | ⏳ Waiting |

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Best path forward:**
1. Complete signup manually (2 min)
2. Upload dist/ folder
3. Go live
4. I continue other tasks autonomously

**Why:** Browser automation is timing out due to gateway issues. Manual is faster than debugging.

**Ready to proceed once account is created!**
